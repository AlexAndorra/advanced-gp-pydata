    "Most of us are familiar with linear regression models, which are a type of *parametric* model. In a linear regression model, we assume that the relationship between the input variables $x$ and the output variable $y$ is linear, and we model the relationship using a linear combination of the input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_p + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p$ are the model parameters and $\\epsilon$ is the error term. The model parameters specify a line in the $p$-dimensional space of input variables, and the error term allows for the data to deviate from the linear prediction. Even if we have data that describe non-linear relationships, we can often use a model that is linear in its parameters by expanding the space of input variables using basis functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\phi_1(x_1) + \\beta_2 \\phi_2(x_2) + \\cdots + \\beta_p \\phi_p(x_p) + \\epsilon$$\n",

    "The limitation of parametric, linear models is that decisions about the form of the relationship between $x$ and $y$ must be made *before* the data have been observed. We can only ever hope to approximate the true relationship, and the quality of the approximation will depend on the choices we made about the form of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to parametric models are *non-parametric* models, which do not make any assumptions about the form of the relationship between $x$ and $y$. Instead, we can use a Gaussian process to model an arbitrary smooth, continuous relationship between $x$ and $y$. Rather than modeling parameters associated with a latent function, these methods predict the function directly.\n"

    "Use of the term \"non-parametric\" in the context of Bayesian analysis is something of a misnomer. This is because the first and fundamental step in Bayesian modeling is to specify a *full probability model* for the problem at hand. It is rather difficult to explicitly state a full probability model without the use of probability functions, which are parametric. Bayesian non-parametric methods do not imply that there are no parameters, but rather that the number of parameters grows with the size of the dataset. In fact, Bayesian non-parametric models are *infinitely* parametric."

    "### Building models with Gaussians\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we chose to use Gaussian distributions to model our data? \n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x \\mid \\pi, \\Sigma) = (2\\pi)^{-k/2}|\\Sigma|^{-1/2} \\exp\\left\\{ -\\frac{1}{2} (x-\\mu)^{\\prime}\\Sigma^{-1}(x-\\mu) \\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There would not seem to be an advantage to doing this, because normal distributions are not particularly flexible distributions in and of themselves. However, adopting a set of Gaussians (a multivariate normal vector) confers a number of advantages. First, the marginal distribution of any subset of elements from  a multivariate normal distribution is also normal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x,y) = \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\left[{\n",
    "\\begin{array}{c}\n",
    "  {\\mu_x}  \\\\\n",
    "  {\\mu_y}  \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "}\\right], \\left[{\n",
    "\\begin{array}{c}\n",
    "  {\\Sigma_x} & {\\Sigma_{xy}}  \\\\\n",
    "  {\\Sigma_{xy}^T} & {\\Sigma_y}  \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "}\\right]\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x) = \\int p(x,y) dy = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_x, \\Sigma_x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, conditionals distributions of a subset of a multivariate normal distribution (conditional on the remaining elements) are normal too:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x|y) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_x + \\Sigma_{xy}\\Sigma_y^{-1}(y-\\mu_y), \n",
    "\\Sigma_x-\\Sigma_{xy}\\Sigma_y^{-1}\\Sigma_{xy}^T)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gaussian process generalizes the multivariate normal to infinite dimension. It is defined as an infinite collection of random variables, any finite subset of which have a Gaussian distribution. Thus, the marginalization property is explicit in its definition. Another way of thinking about an infinite vector is as a *function*. When we write a function that takes continuous values as inputs, we are essentially specifying an infinte vector that only returns values (indexed by the inputs) when the function is called upon to do so. By the same token, this notion of an infinite-dimensional Gaussian as a function allows us to work with them computationally: we are never required to store all the elements of the Gaussian process, only to calculate them on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can describe a Gaussian process as a ***disribution over functions***. Just as a multivariate normal distribution is completely specified by a mean vector and covariance matrix, a GP is fully specified by a **mean function** and a **covariance function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x) \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x,x^{\\prime}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the marginalization property that makes working with a Gaussian process feasible: we can marginalize over the infinitely-many variables that we are not interested in, or have not observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one specification of a GP might be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "m(x) &=0 \\\\\n",
    "k(x,x^{\\prime}) &= \\theta_1\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\theta_2}{2}(x-x^{\\prime})^2\\right)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "here, the covariance function is a **squared exponential**, for which values of $x$ and $x^{\\prime}$ that are close together result in values of $k$ closer to 1 and those that are far apart return values closer to zero. "

Since it is evaluated at every observed data point, its execution time is $\\mathcal{O(n^3)}$, which makes Gaussian processes (in the form I have presented here) impractical for larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach for dealing with this computation complexity is to look for an approximation to accelerate training and prediction. For Gaussian processes, this can be accomplished by employing a **sparse approximation** to the Gram matrix that places $M<<N$ *inducing points* along the range of the input variables, and uses this to estimate the full covariance matrix for the observed points. \n",

It works identically to `gp.Marginal`, except it additionally requires the locations of the inducing points (denoted `Xu`), and it accepts the argument `sigma` instead of `noise` because these sparse approximations assume white IID noise.\n",

The location of the inducing points can also be an unknown and optimized as part of the model.  These sparse approximations are useful for speeding up calculations when the density of data points is high and the lengthscales is larger than the separations between inducing points. "

    "## Hilbert Space Approximate Gaussian Processes (HSGP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hilbert Space Gaussian processes approximation is a **low-rank GP approximation** that is particularly well-suited to usage in probabilistic programming languages.  It approximates the GP using a pre-computed and fixed set of basis functions that don't depend on the form of the covariance kernel or its hyperparameters.  It's a _parametric_ approximation, so prediction can be done as one would with any other type of Bayesian model in PyMC;  You don't need to define the `.conditional` distribution that the `Marginal` and `Latent` GPs rely on.  This makes it _much_ easier to integrate an HSGP into your existing model as they can be used anywhere within a model and with any likelihood function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also fast! 🏃 The computational cost for standard GPs per MCMC step is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of data points.  For HSGPs, it is $\\mathcal{O}(mn + m)$, where $m$ is the number of basis vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The HSGP approximation does carry some caveats:\n",
    "1. It can only be used with _stationary_ covariance kernels such as the Matern family.  The `HSGP` class is compatible with any `Covariance` class that implements the `power_spectral_density` method.  There is a special case made for the `Periodic` covariance, which is implemented in PyMC by `HSGPPeriodic`. \n",
    "2. It does not scale well with the input dimension.  The HSGP approximation is a good choice if your GP is over a one dimensional process like a time series, or a two dimensional spatial point process.  It's likely not an efficient choice where the input dimension is larger than three. \n",
    "3. It _may_ struggle with more rapidly varying processes.  If the process you're trying to model changes very quickly relative to the extent of the domain, the HSGP approximation may fail to accurately represent it.  We'll show in later sections how to set the accuracy of the approximation, which involves a trade-off between the fidelity of the approximation and the computational complexity.\n",
    "4. For smaller data sets, the full unapproximated GP may still be more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary goal of this implementation is **flexibility** via an accessible implementation where the core computations are implemented in a modular way. This results in both a \"high-level\" interface where users can use the familiar `.prior` and `.conditional` methods and essentially treat the HSGP class as a drop in replacement for `pm.gp.Latent`, and a \"low-level\" interface that exposes the HSGP as a parametric model.  For more complex models with multiple HSGPs, users can work directly with functions like `pm.gp.hsgp_approx.calc_eigenvalues` and `pm.gp.hsgp_approx.calc_eigenvectors`."

In this example these are both one element lists since our example is in a one dimensional, time series like context.  Before continuing, it's helpful to define $S$ as the half range of the centered data, or the distance from the midpoint at $x=0$ to the edge, $x=5$.  In this example $S=5$ for each plot panel.  Then, we can define $c$ such that it relates $S$ to $L$, \n",

This means that the HSGP approximation becomes poor as you get closer to $x=-5$ and $x=5$.  How quickly depends on the lengthscale.  Large lengthscales require larger values of $L$ and $c$, and smaller lengthscales attenuate this issue.  Ruitort-Mayol *et al.* recommend using 1.2 as a minimum value.  The effect of this choice on the basis vectors is shown in the center panel.  \n",

Larger values of $L$ or $c$ make the boundary conditions less problematic, and are required to accurately approximate GPs with longer lengthscales.  You also need to consider where predictions will need to be made.  In addition to the locations of the observed $x$ values, the locations of the new $x$ locations also need to be away from the \"pinch\" caused by the boundary condition.

The right-most panel is an example of this.  It can be very beneficial to sampling to drop the first eigenvector in these situations.  The `HSGP` and `HSGPPeriodic` class in PyMC both have the option `drop_first` to do this, or if you're using `.prior_linearized` you can control this yourself.  Be sure to check the basis vectors if the sampler is having issues.\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, you'll need to infer the lengthscale from the data, so the HSGP needs to approximate a GP across a range of lengthscales that are representative of your chosen prior.  You'll need to choose $c$ large enough to handle the largest lengthscales you might fit, and also choose $m$ large enough to accommodate the smallest lengthscales.  Ruitort-Mayol *et al.* give some handy heuristics for the range of lengthscales that are accurately reproduced for given values of $m$ and $c$.  The plot below uses their heuristics to recommend minimum $m$ and $c$ value.  Note that these recommendations are based on a one-dimensional GP."
